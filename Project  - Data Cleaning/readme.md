### THIS IS THE READ ME TO MY DATA CLEANING PROJECT 17/01/2020

In the Project folder, you can find the clean_shark.csv Dataset and my Notebook to follow each step of the Data cleaning Process. 

##### Here is an overview of what I did:

First I imported the dataset. To do so, I had to change the format to uft-8. 
After that, I imported relevant Packages and changed general settings - like row width and viewing rows /cols 
After that I tried to create meaning out of the dataset by going through the first rows and checking the data types. 

I concluded with the following agenda to clean the data --> 

The Agenda will also be the structure of my Notebook

### AGENDA FOR TRANSFORMATIONS

- DATE: Set String to Date Time
- NAME: If Name "female/male" change to NAN
- AGE: Change Age to INT - if its not clear, that change Age to NAN
