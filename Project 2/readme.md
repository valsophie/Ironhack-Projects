THIS IS THE READ ME TO MY DATA CLEANING PROJECT 17/01/2020

In the Project folder, you can find the clean_shark.csv Dataset and my Notebook to follow each step of the Data cleanung Process. 

Here is an overview of what I did:

First I imported the dataset. To do so, I had to change the format to uft-8. 
After that, I imported relevant Packages and changed general settings - like row width and viewing rows /cols 
After that I tried to create meaning out of the dataset by going through the first rows and checking the data types. 

I concluded with the following agenda to clean the data -->
